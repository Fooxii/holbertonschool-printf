.TH _PRINTF 3 "

.SH NAME
_printf - Print function implemented

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf fucntion produces an output in relation with a format string.
It will be a simplified recreation of the standard C printf, it also supports 
a limited set of conversion specifiers.

The function parses the string format one character at a given time.
Normal characters are printed as is. When a percent sign (%) is found, _printf checks the next character to determine the correct action.

All output is written using the write () system call. The function returns the total
number of characters printed.

.SH SUPPORTED FORMAT SPECIFIERS
The following format specifiers are implemented in this version:

.TP
.B %c
It prints a single character.

.TP
.B %s
It prints a null-terminated string. If the string is NULL, "(null)" is printed.

.TP
.B %%
Will print a literal percent sign.

.TP
.B %d
It prints a signed integer in decimal notation.

.TP
.B %i
It is equivalent to %d. Prints a signed integer in decimal notation. 

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of characters printed.
If format is NULL, the function returns -1.

.SH IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
_printf uses variadic arguments (va_list, va_start, va_arg, va_end).
Parsing and dispatching to the correct printing funciton is handled internally by pick_specifier().

The integers (%d and %i) are converted manually using division and modulus operations.
No standard library conversions like: printf, sprintf, itoa; are used.
